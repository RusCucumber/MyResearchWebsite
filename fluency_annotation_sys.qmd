## Oral Fluency Feature Annotation System

Oral fluency feature annotation system is a open-source program which allows users to detect temporal speech features, including disfluency words (e.g., repetitions, self-repairs, & false starts) and pause locations (i.e., mid- & end-clause pauses) and calculate utterance fluency measures (See [Matsuura et al. (2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772766124000831) for more detailed information). Python scripts of the system are available [here](https://github.com/RusCucumber/FluencyFeatureAnnotator).

### Installation

1.  **Install Docker**
    -   Following steps in the [link](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/), install and set up Docker in your computer.
2.  **Pull Docker image**
    -   Run the following command in Terminal.

        ```{docker pull ruscucumber/fluency-feature-annotator:0.2.0}
        ```
3.  **Run Docker container**
    -   Run the following command in Terminal.

        ```{docker run -d -p 8001:8001 -v ~/Downloads:/app/fluencyfeatureannotator/results -it --name ffa ruscucumber/fluency-feature-annotator:0.2.0}
        ```
4.  **Open Web application**
    -   Open the following URL in your browser: <http://127.0.0.1:8001/>

### Usage

1.  Prepare pairs of `wav` and `txt` files.
    -   You need to ensure that the filenames of `wav` and `txt` are the same.

    -   Remove punctuations and symbols (e.g., `.`, `,`, `!`, `?`, `"`, `&`, `$`, `-`) in `txt` files.
2.  Click "① Select wav & txt files" button and select target files.
3.  Click "② Upload wav & txt files" button and upload selected files.
4.  Click "③ Annotate fluency features" button.
5.  Check your Downloads directory.
    -   Annotation results are saved as a TextGrid format in results folder.

    -   Utterance fluency measures are saved as "results/result.csv".

### Limitations

-   To use the current version of the system, you need to ensure at least 5GB of available storage space.

-   The current version of the system has only been tested on the following environment. It is not currently guaranteed that the system will work in other environments.

|                    |                    |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **OS**             | macOS Ventura 13.4 |
| **RAM**            | Apple M1 16GB      |
| **Python version** | 3.9.6              |

-   Since the current version of the system saves the results of annotation as "result.csv", please be careful to avoid overwriting a file with the same name.

-   If you input long audio files (e.g., long than 3 mins), the current version of the system may stop automatic annotation due to a memory issue.
