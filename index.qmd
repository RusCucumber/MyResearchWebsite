## Research

My research interests lie in the effective assessment, feedback, and learning assistance of L2 speech utilizing AI/ML techniques. More specifically, I have conducted research of automated scoring systems for L2 oral fluency. My master's dissertation study aimed to automatize effective *recasts* and explored linguistic factors in dialogic responses which affect interlocutor's comprehensibility focusing on lexical error types and rhetorical roles of utterances. In my Ph.D. study, I intend to develop and validate *Computerized Dynamic Assessment* (*C-DA*) systems for L2 productive knowledge and skills. In addition, I am interested in expanding research methods in applied linguistic using state-of-the-art AI technologies. I developed a system to automatically annotate the full range of oral fluency features (i.e., syllables, disfluency words, and pause locations). I am open to collaborating with researchers worldwide by automatizing L2 data annotations and analyses.
